### Clear Space & Sizing
- Always maintain clear space around the logo equivalent to 20% of the logo's width.
- Minimum size for digital display should be `24x24px`.

## 5. UI Application
- Use **Electric Cyan** sparingly for key calls to action (CTAs).
- Components should favor subtle borders (`1px solid #2A324A`) over heavy shadows to maintain a flat, modern aesthetic.
- Radius should be soft but sharp (`border-radius: 6px` for standard elements).
